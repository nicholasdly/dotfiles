### Installation

1. Clone the repo into your home directory (`~`).
2. Run the [`config.sh`](config.sh) script, which will extract all of the dotfiles into your home directory: `./config.sh`.
3. If zsh responds with "permission denied," you can give the file execution permission: `chmod u+x ./config.sh`.
